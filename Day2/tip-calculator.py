#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# Round to two decimal places

# print(round(9 / 3, 2))
# print(9 // 2) # Using // turns this float into an int.


12 / 100
0.12
150 * 0.12
18.0
150 + 18
# OR
150 * 1.12

168 / 5
33.6
